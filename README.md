# PROJECTS-IN-PYTHON-
1. PROJECT: TELEPHONE DIRECTORY APPLICATION
# Most cell phones have a telephone directory (or in some cases called "Address
# Book", or "Contact List"). 
# The program have the following features:
#(a) Ability to add new addresses to the directory.
#(b) Ability to modify existing addresses in the directory.
#(c) Ability to delete addresses in the directory.
#(d) Ability to display all the entries in the directory.
#(e) Ability to add various pieces of information per individual in the directory - telephone number, home address and so on.

# Telephone directory is saved in a text file so that even after you quit the program and later restart it, you can read the contents
# of the directory from the text file.
# Example:
# John Smith; 123-456-789; 123 Hello Lane, Santa Clara, CA 95051
# Jeff David; 456-123-789; 456 Hello Lane, Santa Clara, CA 95051
