1. PROJECT: TELEPHONE DIRECTORY APPLICATION

   Most cell phones have a telephone directory (or in some cases called "Address Book", or "Contact List").    
   The program have the following features:   
   (a) Ability to add new addresses to the directory.   
   (b) Ability to modify existing addresses in the directory.   
   (c) Ability to delete addresses in the directory.   
   (d) Ability to display all the entries in the directory.   
   (e) Ability to add various pieces of information per individual in the directory - telephone number, home address and so on.
      
   Telephone directory is saved in a text file so that even after you quit the program and later restart it, you can read the  
   contents of the directory from the text file.   
   Example:   
   John Smith; 123-456-789; 123 Hello Lane, Santa Clara, CA 95051   
   Jeff David; 456-123-789; 456 Hello Lane, Santa Clara, CA 95051
