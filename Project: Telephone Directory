# Telephone directory Application:
# Most cell phones have a telephone directory (or in some cases called "Address
# Book", or "Contact List"). 
# The program should have the following features:
#(a) Ability to add new addresses to the directory.
#(b) Ability to modify existing addresses in the directory.
#(c) Ability to delete addresses in the directory.
#(d) Ability to display all the entries in the directory.
#(e) Ability to add various pieces of information per individual in the directory -
# telephone number, home address and so on.

# Please save the contents of the telephone directory in a text file so that
# even after you quit the program and later restart it, you can read the contents
# of the directory from the text file.
# You can save the data in a simple text file, one entry per line,
# something like this:
# John Smith; 123-456-789; 123 Hello Lane, Santa Clara, CA 95051
# Jeff David; 456-123-789; 456 Hello Lane, Santa Clara, CA 95051
